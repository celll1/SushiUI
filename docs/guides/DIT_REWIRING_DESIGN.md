# DiT residual rewiring contract

Status: accepted implementation contract. Canonical topology validation and
side-effect-free preview APIs are implemented. Qwen-Image 2.1 has an internal
forward path with checkpointed backward verification. Training request/YAML
configuration is connected for Qwen LoRA/full runs. Generation topology
reporting and adapter-stack restoration are connected for Qwen; production
acceptance remains pending. The training graphical
editor is connected; browser rendering and interaction acceptance are pending.
Full Qwen artifact save/restore is connected; production acceptance remains pending. Other
architectures require individual capability gates.

## Default topology

A new user-selected U-Net conversion defaults to two nested regions with four
blocks at the deepest level. This does not automatically convert ordinary models
or replace the topology declared by an existing checkpoint.

For Qwen-Image 2.1's 32 main blocks, block indices are zero-based half-open:

| Region | Block interval | Spatial downsample relative to parent |
|---|---|---|
| Outer | `[4, 28)` | 2 by 2 |
| Inner | `[14, 18)` | 2 by 2 |

At 1024px, eight blocks use 4096 image tokens, twenty use 1024 tokens, and four
use 256 tokens. The latent input/output grid and text tokens retain their native
meaning. The default block allocation is:

| Zero-based blocks | Image token grid at 1024px | Tokens per block | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[0, 4)`, `[28, 32)` | 64 by 64 | 4096 | 8 |
| `[4, 14)`, `[18, 28)` | 32 by 32 | 1024 | 20 |
| `[14, 18)` | 16 by 16 | 256 | 4 |

```text
blocks    0..3    4..13    14..17    18..27    28..31
tokens    4096    1024       256      1024      4096
outer skip        [----------------------)
inner skip                  [-----)
```

Each skip connects its region entry to its exit, restoring that region's residual
update. The outer region is `[4, 28)` and the inner region is `[14, 18)`.
The 1024 values above describe image token counts, not image pixels.

This allocation retains more blocks at 1024 tokens than the sixteen-deepest-block
probe. Its image-token-linear work is approximately 41.40625% of dense execution;
this is not a full-model FLOP or throughput estimate. Fixed pooling and upsampling
add no parameters, so checkpoint parameter size does not shrink. The measured
quality improvement is partial and still requires calibration.

Other architectures must resolve valid model-specific intervals before
registering a default; do not reuse these indices without validation.

## Execution

Each region preserves its input image hidden states and executes its blocks on
a pooled copy. Restore only the update:

```text
low_in = pool(hidden)
low_out = execute_region(low_in)
hidden = saved_hidden + upsample(low_out - low_in)
```

Use fixed average pooling, bilinear upsampling with `align_corners=False`, and
identity delta addition initially. Each nested region performs its own subtraction
and restoration. Preserve text updates, native block order, masks, positions,
conditioning, gradient checkpointing, and offload ownership. Region context is
per forward and must not depend on a mutable global skip stack.

Allow nested or disjoint regions; refuse crossing regions, cycles, reordered
blocks, unsupported stream transitions, and indivisible grids. Rebuild coarse
positions using the architecture's coordinate contract. Restore the original
grid and context before final output projection.

## Configuration and artifacts

All API defaults and presets belong to `backend/api/param_defaults.py`.
Configuration is architecture-neutral, with per-architecture generation and
training capabilities. Do not add rewired variants to ModelType/ARCH_REGISTRY.

Store a versioned canonical JSON topology, its SHA256, architecture, stream block
counts, block-layout/config identities, intervals, parent regions, operator and
position rules, and any learned topology tensors. Safetensors metadata values
are strings. Single files, shard indices, and directory artifacts must agree.
Unknown versions, incompatible layouts, missing tensors, or conflicting metadata
must fail before mutating the active model. Metadata cannot execute Python.

Generation restores the checkpoint topology automatically and shows it read-only.
Training can inherit a topology or configure a new conversion. Resume requires
agreement between run configuration and checkpoint topology. LoRA artifacts must
carry their required topology and base identity; incompatible adapter stacks must
be refused atomically. Preserve existing adapter capability tables.

## Editor and acceptance

Provide a shared graphical topology renderer: block index on the horizontal axis,
resolution levels on the vertical axis, draggable interval endpoints, and explicit
skip edges. Show image pixels, latent grid, token grid, per-level counts, and
validation errors. Backend-resolved plans are authoritative for editor previews.
Keep presets, YAML editing, clone, export, and queues consistent.

The uncalibrated Qwen probes show blur and granular artifacts. Shortening the
deepest region from sixteen to four blocks improves some shapes but does not
establish acceptable quality or universal performance gains. Calibration and
fine-tuning quality, full/LoRA save-load-resume, production dtype gradients,
checkpointing/offload, API round trips, and per-architecture gates remain required.
Do not infer reduced checkpoint/optimizer size from reduced token computation.

The method was assessed from
[lodestone-rock/residual-to-unet](https://github.com/lodestone-rock/residual-to-unet/tree/4834458ea1e2dbede89e776ebccbe23233d10fd0).
Its seven-layer linear reference is not a real DiT quality or speed benchmark.
The SushiUI probe is independently written from the residual-update formulation.

## Current verification boundary

`GET /api/v1/schema/dit-rewiring` supplies presets and
`POST /api/v1/models/rewiring/validate` returns a validated grid/skip plan.
These endpoints do not enable model execution; runtime capabilities remain empty
until model loading and training requests enforce the complete artifact contract.

The internal Qwen forward currently accepts a single uncached 2D target grid
with native causal modulation. References, cached execution, partition positions,
input residuals, and style contexts are refused. Native block execution and its
gradient-checkpointing call remain in charge of attention and recomputation.
CPU verification covers an independent nested residual output/gradient oracle,
FP32/BF16/FP16 identity regions, local context restoration, actual Qwen blocks,
and the full Qwen forward with backward. Production GPU dtype/offload and artifact
save-load-resume verification remain acceptance gates.

Full Qwen transformer artifacts and training bundles now restore validated topology
metadata; full and LoRA writers record it. Native config identity excludes loader
annotations and includes every Qwen constructor setting with resolved defaults.
Shard index and all referenced shard headers must declare the same topology.
Tiny actual Qwen full-writer/load-transformer round trips cover single and sharded
files, exact parameter restoration, numerically matching forward output, config
mismatch, and a tampered shard. LoRA stack application, full-size GPU artifacts,
training-bundle companion restoration, and training resume remain unverified.

Training accepts `dit_rewiring_mode` (`inherit` or `configure`) and an optional
`dit_rewiring_spec`, with defaults in `TRAINING_DEFAULTS`. Configure with no spec
resolves the native-layout preset after loading; inherit with a spec asserts exact
agreement. API requests and YAML preflight validate the structure. Qwen component
loading installs the resolved topology, and LoRA resume checks its metadata before
loading weights. Full resume prohibits topology edits. Sampling a rewired training
model disables KV caching. Current gates refuse partition training/global adapters,
TREAD, REPA, and block skipping. CPU contracts cover request/YAML parity, default
resolution, inheritance, resume comparison, and refusal without model mutation.
Actual trainer steps, persisted run/resume state and UI round trips remain pending.

The training editor uses `POST /api/v1/models/rewiring/inspect` to obtain native
config/layout identities, saved topology, and the resolved preset from file headers.
It previews pixel/latent dimensions and per-level block/token counts through the
validation API. The shared SVG renderer draws the resolution sequence and residual
skip arcs; draggable boundaries, numeric endpoints, per-axis factors, parent
selection, nested-region addition and subtree removal edit the same request spec.
`PARAM_KEYS` carries both settings through clone, presets and run restoration.
The backend inspection API is tested without tensor loading or model construction.
Frontend build/type checking remain owner-run; browser/editor validation is pending.

Generation preflights the entire Qwen LoRA stack before branch installation.
Declared native config and topology must agree across every file and with a
rewired full checkpoint. A legacy adapter with no topology declaration denotes
the native sequence and cannot be mixed with rewired adapters. On a dense base,
a consistent rewired stack temporarily installs its topology; unload restores
the base using model-specific weakref ownership. Invalid structure/shape stacks
leave the model untouched. Generation exceptions also unload branches/topology.
Rewired generation excludes partition/reference/style workflows, validates the
actual grid, and disables KV caching. PNG/gallery parameters record the effective
spec/hash and cache policy. Loaded full-model topology is shown read-only through
the shared graph in the model selector. Real AdapterSession CPU contracts cover
these installation/refusal/lifetime paths; denoising in this test is a stub.
Production GPU generation and frontend rendering remain unverified.
